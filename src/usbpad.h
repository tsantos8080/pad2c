/* A USB gamepad read straight from its /dev/ugenB.A node, beside the
 * console's own HID driver (which holds the interface but does nothing with
 * a device it does not know).
 *
 * Today: the 8BitDo 2.4G dongle (2dc8:301c). With no controller it shows up
 * as "8BitDo IDLE" and sends nothing useful; when the controller connects it
 * enumerates again as "8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller" and sends
 * report 1 (see usbpad.c). The Wukong model uses XInput (2dc8:310a).
 * Every re-enumeration ends the open device, so the caller closes it and looks again.
